//! ===================================== Event Propagation =====================================

// Event propagation helps you control and organize how different parts of your webpage respond
// to user actions. It allows you to capture events at different phases, enabling more flexible
// and modular code.

// Event propagation in React JSX is the process of an event moving through the component hierarchy.
// It includes both the capturing and bubbling phases.

// Similar to the event bubbling example, event propagation involves the natural flow of events
// through the component tree.
